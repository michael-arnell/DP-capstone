To run this application:
    1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
    2) Navigate to the capstone folder in your terminal.
    3) Run 'pipenv shell'

NOTE: If you have removed the comp_tracker.db database, you can recreate it by running the create_tables.py module in place of main.py on step 4. You will be prompted to create a user as part of this module and should create that user as a manager. Afterwards, when first running main.py, I recommend following the instructions to import the file 'Assessment Results.csv'
